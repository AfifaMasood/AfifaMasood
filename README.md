This repository contains the FYP work on shoplifting detection using deep learning.
It includes multiple models (ConvLSTM, CNN, MovieNet, CNN-RNN, YOLO + ResNet) trained for detecting suspicious activities.
The code, datasets, and model training scripts are available for reference and further improvements.
